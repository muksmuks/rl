**Mastering any machine learning topic** requires effort. A systematic approach is required to understand and master it. I follow this 4-layered inverted onion approach and have found it to be useful.

### Layer 1 - Get intuition about the topic. 

Intuition helps link the concept to something we already know and hence increases the chance of recalling the topic. Study materials which give intuition have explanations using animations, explain concepts using real life as an example.  

The contents I usually follow are written by

**Mathematics** : [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)
<br>
**Statistics/DS**:  [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.youtube.com/c/Kozyrkov)
<br>
**NLP**: [Jay Alammar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmOwsoHty5PrmE-3QhUBfPQ)
<br>
**DL/ML** : [Luis Serrano](https://www.youtube.com/c/LuisSerrano)


### Layer 2:  Conceptual Understanding
The intention at this layer, is to have an understanding of standard terms and concepts used in topic. 

Pick up material which cover the topic in expanded format. A expanded format will explain the topic and reinforce the knowledge with a coding example. Many a times code example, helps understand the concept much easily than mathematics explanation

If you prefer books, **Groking** series  of books fall at this level. They have friendly explaination about the topic
For video tutorials, courses from udacity/coursera would be good pick. I do not prefer udemy at this stage, as creators may use non-standard terms for concepts which may lead to confusions.

 
### Layer 3 - Standardised Understanding
This is time when we pick a book which is considered as the bible on the topic. These books introduce terms  and concepts which are used and should be used in research paper, blogs, derivative books like grokking series . 

The field of machine learning faces the issue of having many terms being used for the same concept due to it being influenced by various disciplines like mathematics, neurology , psychology and industrial concepts.

The topic treatment in these books are dense and sometimes involved. Read the concepts without too much focus on the mathematical formulations. The code understanding gained early will equip us to understand the mathematics better

**DL** : Deep Learning - Ian Goodfellow et al

**RL** : Reinforcement learning - Sutton and Barto

### Layer 4 - Mathematical foundation
This is often the most involved and may need many cups of black coffee. But having gained intuition and code understanding would have prepared and smoothened the transition to towards understanding this.

### Why is the onion inverted?
Well mathematics can be dry to consume, hence that layer might be acquired taste.
